# Simple Notes (Security Demo Application)

This application is used for taking simple notes, like "Everyone needs to go ahead and come in on Saturday and Sunday to help out with the new code push." It is used to demo many of GitLab's Security features. Be sure to read the documentation within the [**Simple Notes Documentation**](https://tech-marketing.gitlab.io/devsecops/initech/simple-notes/) which contains Architecture, Development Guide, Instructions on Creating Vulnerability, and much more.

This project is meant to be used within your GitLab instance so that you can view the pipelines, create MRs with security vulnerabilities and much more. To get started with DevSecOps on GitLab with this project, you can start with [Lesson 1, prerequisites](https://tech-marketing.gitlab.io/devsecops/initech/simple-notes/getting_started/lesson_1_prerequisites/), as well as this YouTube video I have created:
